**⚠️ Is this a ChartFox.org feature?**
Please note that this project is a **Desktop Wrapper** for the ChartFox service.
*   If you are requesting new charts, changes to the map interface, or account features, please request them from the [ChartFox team](https://chartfox.org/) directly.
*   If your request is about the **application window**, **system integration** (tray, shortcuts), or **Electron-specific features**, you are in the right place!

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when I have to Alt-Tab to check a chart...

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. Ex. It would be great to have an 'Always on Top' toggle in the menu so the chart stays visible over the simulator.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

**Additional context**
Add any other context, mockups, or screenshots about the feature request here.

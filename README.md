## 📖 About This Project

**ChartFox Desktop** brings the power of the ChartFox web platform to your desktop environment. While ChartFox is an incredible tool for flight simulation, running it in a browser tab isn't always ideal for a dedicated cockpit setup.

This project creates a focused, distraction-free "Electronic Flight Bag" (EFB) experience that sits separately from your browser, making it easier to Alt-Tab or move to a secondary monitor during critical phases of flight.

### ✨ Key Features

*   **🚀 Lightweight architecture:** A minimal footprint wrapper designed to stay out of your way.
*   **🛠️ Zero Configuration:** No need to install browser extensions. so **it just works**.
*   **🖥️ Dedicated Window:** Keep your charts separate from your YouTube videos and Wiki pages.
*   **🌐 Multi-Platform:** Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
